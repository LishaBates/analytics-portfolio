# Business Intelligence Portfolio

Welcome to my BI & automation portfolio. This collection highlights real-world projects I‚Äôve built using **Power BI**, **SharePoint**, **Excel**, **Teams**, and **Azure DevOps**.

Many of my Excel-based dashboards are powered by **ADO query imports**, with dynamic data manipulation using functions like **XLOOKUP**. I also integrate **Teams-based approvals** through Power Automate and create self-serve tools to help leadership and internal teams track progress, approvals, and trends efficiently.
